  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Q: Why now?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">A:<br><strong>Because there's no time like the present.</strong> <br><br>Trans people have already been discriminated against in this country too long, and with the new labour government cracking down on free speech, human rights, and our functuional ability to transition, there has never been a time more urgent for direct action against the establishment. <br><br><b>Trans people are so distinctly under threat</b>, and suicides and murders are rising both internationally and in the UK. The state of trans healthcare, education, and day-to-day discrimination is as high as it's ever been in the modern period. <br><br>It's shameful, and it's doubly shameful we haven't risen up to bash back already.</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Q: Is Bash Back violent?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">A: Bash Back is a <b>nonviolent direct action group.</b></div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Q: What does “direct action” mean?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">A: Direct action is the process of tackling a political problem at its source. <br><br>For Bash Back this means recognising and targeting the specific institutions which profit from transphobia, and — rather than approaching with dialogue or protest — striking where it hurts: the wallet. Direct action is often risky, and rarely legal, but fundamentally effective.</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Q: Why direct action?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">A:<br>Because so many of us have already been to the prides, been to the pickets, been involved in art and protest and journalism and academia and time and time again have found that <strong>IT IS NOT WORKING.</strong>
  <br><br>Direct action is just one of a number of strategies to challenge the transphobic establishment at its door, and to show our rage unfettered.</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Q: Isn’t direct action dangerous?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">A: Of course direct action is dangerous, but so is everyday life as a trans person in the UK. <br><br>The principle of acting against wealthy institutions and transphobic agitators necessarily comes with risks. We endeavour to keep all of our actionists safe by practicing non-hierarchical mutual aid, and never performing any action which could endanger life or cause physical harm to another person.</div>
</div>



<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Q: Do you have anything to do with the US group “Bash Back!”?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">A: Nope! Just a lucky coincidence. <br><br>We share a lot of their values and beliefs, but we are unaffiliated.</div>
</div>
